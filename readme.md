# cpp basic compiler

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a standard c++ compiler for each platform.

- Support for windows and linux
- Only python3 as dependency
- Works out of the gate
- Small size
- Only installed within local folder, remove it and it will not have affected your computer

## Installation

Just run setup.py, it will

For linux, install gcc(~1.5GB) inside compiler/gcc-13.2.0

For windows, install mingw64(~703 MB) inside compiler/mingw64

linux source: [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-13.2.0/]() (Then built from source)

windows source(x86_64-15.1.0-release-posix-seh-ucrt-rt_v12-rev0): [https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases](), also see: [https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/]()

## Note

If you have many projects, you probably want to install a compiler system-wide so you only need to install it once.

See the links below for installation instructions for your specific platform:
