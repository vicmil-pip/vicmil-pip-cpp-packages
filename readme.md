# cpp basic compiler

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a standard c++ compiler for each platform.

- Support for windows and linux
- Only python3 as dependency
- Works out of the gate
- Small size
- Only installed within local folder, remove it and it will not have affected your computer

## Installation

Just run setup.py, it will

For linux, install a minimal build of clang(~880 MB) inside /clang

For windows, install mingw64 build(~460 MB) inside /mingw64

## Note

If you have many projects, you probably want to install a compiler system-wide so you only need to install it once.
