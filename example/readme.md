# cppBindings example

Minimal example that shows how to compile a c++ library, and then load it into python and execute one of its functions

## Getting started

buildme.py: file to build the c++ code and generate the bindings, output saved in /bin

run_lib.py: file to call the c++ code from python, you need to run buildme.py first
